## READ the instructions in its entirety before deploying!

This template deploys multiple VMs and requires some pre-work before you can successfully deploy the OpenShift Cluster.  If you don't get the pre-work done correctly, you will most likely fail to deploy the cluster using this template.  Please read the instructions completely before you proceed. 

This template allows you to choose between a custom VHD image in an existing Storage Account or the On-Demand Red Hat Enterprise Linux image from the Azure Gallery. 
>If you use the On-Demand image, there is an hourly charge for using this image.  At the same time, the instance will be registered to your Red Hat subscription so you will also be using one of your entitlements. This will lead to "double billing".

After successful deployment, the Bastion Node is no longer required.  You can turn it off and delete it or keep it around for running future playbooks.

## Prerequisites

### Generate SSH Keys

You'll need to generate an SSH key pair (Public / Private) in order to provision this template. Ensure that you do **NOT** include a passphrase with the private key. <br/><br/>
If you are using a Windows computer, you can download puttygen.exe.  You will need to export to OpenSSH (from Conversions menu) to get a valid Private Key for use in the Template.<br/><br/>
From a Linux or Mac, you can just use the ssh-keygen command.  Once you are finished deploying the cluster, you can always generate new keys that uses a passphrase and replace the original ones used during inital deployment.

### Create Key Vault to store SSH Private Key

You will need to create a Key Vault to store your SSH Private Key that will then be used as part of the deployment.  This extra work is to provide security around the Private Key - especially since it does not have a passphrase.  I recommend creating a Resource Group specifically to store the KeyVault.  This way, you can reuse the KeyVault for other deployments and you won't have to create this every time you chose to deploy another OpenShift cluster.

1. Create KeyVault using Powershell <br/>
  a.  Create new resource group: `New-AzureRMResourceGroup -Name 'ResourceGroupName' -Location 'West US'`<br/>
  b.  Create key vault: `New-AzureRmKeyVault -VaultName 'KeyVaultName' -ResourceGroup 'ResourceGroupName' -Location 'West US'`<br/>
  c.  Create variable with sshPrivateKey: `$securesecret = ConvertTo-SecureString -String '[copy ssh Private Key here - including line feeds]' -AsPlainText -Force`<br/>
  d.  Create Secret: `Set-AzureKeyVaultSecret -Name 'SecretName' -SecretValue $securesecret -VaultName 'KeyVaultName'`<br/>
  e.  Enable for Template Deployment: `Set-AzureRMKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName 'KeyVaultName' -ResourceGroupName 'ResourceGroupName' -EnabledForTemplateDeployment`<br/>

2. **Create Key Vault using Azure CLI**<br/>
  a.  Create new Resource Group: azure group create \<name\> \<location\> <br/>
         Ex: `azure group create ResourceGroupName 'East US'` <br/>
  b.  Create Key Vault: azure keyvault create -u \<vault-name\> -g \<resource-group\> -l \<location\><br/>
         Ex: `azure keyvault create -u KeyVaultName -g ResourceGroupName -l 'East US'`<br/>
  c.  Create Secret: azure keyvault secret set -u \<vault-name\> -s \<secret-name\> --file \<private-key-file-name\><br/>
         Ex: `azure keyvault secret set -u KeyVaultName -s SecretName --file ~/.ssh/id_rsa` <br/>
  d.  Enable the Keyvvault for Template Deployment: azure keyvault set-policy -u \<vault-name\> --enabled-for-template-deployment true <br/>
         Ex: `azure keyvault set-policy -u KeyVaultName --enabled-for-template-deployment true` <br/>

### Red Hat Subscription Access

For security reasons, the method for registering the RHEL system has been changed to allow the use of an Organization ID and Activation Key as well as a Username and Password. Please know that it is more secure to use the Organizatoin ID and Activation Key.

You can determine your Organization ID by running ```subscription-manager identity``` on a registered machine.  To create or find your Activation Key, please go here: https://access.redhat.com/management/activation_keys.

You will also need to get the Pool ID that contains your entitlements for OpenShift.  You can retrieve this from the Red Hat portal by examining the details of the subscription that has the OpenShift entitlements.  Or you can contact your Red Hat administrator to help you.

## Deploy Template

Deploy to Azure using Azure Portal: 
<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fharoldwongms%2Fopenshift-containerplatform%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/></a>
<a href="http://armviz.io/#/?load=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fharoldwongms%2Fopenshift-containerplatform%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank">
    <img src="http://armviz.io/visualizebutton.png"/>
</a><br/>

Once you have collected all of the prerequisites for the template, you can deploy the template by clicking Deploy to Azure or populating the **azuredeploy.parameters.json** file and executing Resource Manager deployment commands with PowerShell or the Azure CLI.

### NOTE

The OpenShift Ansible playbook does take a while to run when using VMs backed by Standard Storage. VMs backed by Premium Storage are faster. If you want Premium Storage, select a DS or GS series VM.
<hr />
Be sure to follow the OpenShift instructions to create the necessary DNS entry for the OpenShift Router for access to applications. <br />

Currently there is a hickup in the deployment of metrics and logging that will cause the deployment to take a little longer than normal.  When you look at the stdout files on the Bastion host, you will see that the installation had numerous retries for certain playbook tasks.  This is normal.

### TROUBLESHOOTING

If you encounter an error during deployment of the cluster, please view the deployment status.  The following Error Codes will help to narrow things down.

1. Exit Code 3: Your Red Hat Subscription User Name / Password or Organization ID / Activation Key is incorrect
2. Exit Code 4: Your Red Hat Pool ID is incorrect or there are no entitlements available
3. Exit Code 5: Unable to provision Docker Thin Pool Volume
4. Exit Code 6: Unable to mount filesystem on Master zero node for NFS 

For further troubleshooting, please SSH into your Bastion node on port 22.  You will need to be root **(sudo su -)** and then navigate to the following directory: **/var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download**<br/><br/>
You should see a folder named '0' and '1'.  In each of these folders, you will see two files, stderr and stdout.  You can look through these files to determine where the failure occurred.

## Post-Deployment Operations

### Metrics and logging

To display metrics and logs, you need to logon to OpenShift ( https://publicDNSname:8443 ) go into the logging project, click on the Kubana route and accept the SSL exception in your brower, then do the same with the Hawkster metrics route in the openshift-infra project.

### Creation of additional users

To create additional (non-admin) users in your environment, login to your master server(s) via SSH and run:
<br><i>htpasswd /etc/origin/master/htpasswd mynewuser</i>

### Access to Cockpit

Use user 'root' and the same password as you assigned to your OpenShift admin to login to Cockpit ( https://publicDNSname:9090 ).
   
### Additional OpenShift Configuration Options
 
You can configure additional settings per the official (<a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/welcome/index.html" target="_blank">OpenShift Enterprise Documentation</a>).
